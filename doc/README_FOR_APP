Sample app using the render_static gem to render js content for crawlers

To see it in action:

- start the server with 'bundle exec unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb -p 3000'
- CURL as a regular user would: curl http://localhost:3000/ - you should see a blank page
- CURL as a googlebot: curl -A "Googlebot" http://localhost:3000/ - you should see a page with content on it (which was generated by javascript)
